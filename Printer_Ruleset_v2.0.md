# <span style="color:turquoise"><p style="text-align: center;"> **PRINTING RULES**


-	New users should be added to the MS Teams “3D Printer Robotics” team – this is done by having the PI contacting the 3D printer administrator (Diego Vedelago – ADVRF).

-   Setup GrabCAD according to the next section.

-	Only Admins will be able to start jobs accordingly to queue schedule. 

-   The printing queue will be handled by the Admins.

-   Any Job with a duration between 5 and 12hrs **must** be submitted to the 3D Printer Admins (Diego Vedelago - Yussef Hasssanien) for review – you must send Grabcad's .print projects. 

-	Any job longer than 12 hours **must** be commissioned to IIT’s workshop.

## <span style="color:turquoise"> <p style="text-align: center;"> ***GrabCAD Setup***</span>

-   Download the latest release of GrabCAD from Stratasys website.

-   While installing GrabCAD make sure to be completely disconnected from Internet, as we-re not using a GrabCAD cloud account, and choose to use the "offline mode".

-	Before putting any job in the queue be sure to register yourself in Grabcad with recognizable name and ask the Admin for a preliminary training.

-	Example of recognizable name for John Doe: “ JDoe”, "jdoe", "jane_doe", "j_doe", "JDOE", "J_DOE". 

-	This is mandatory and helps to refer jobs to people, track budget expenses and so on. 

## <span style="color:turquoise"> <p style="text-align: center;"> ***Tips***</span>

-	You can use STEP files, Stl files as well as Creo prt files.

-	Minimize support material usage by orienting the model on printer plate (e.g. make holes lie flat or try to avoid overhanging parts). 

-	Understand the different option in the “Tray Settings” and “Model Settings” that allow to maximize mechanical resistance and minimize materials usage. 

-   Avoid printing boxes that can be made by modifying or by creating add-ons for commercial enclosure from catalogs like RS/Hammond Enclosures/Bopla/etc.

-	If you have doubts or need help, please contact one of the Facility’s technician.
